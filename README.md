# twitter-bot
Twitter bot that will post images from Safebooru, an anime imageboard.

This script is used with Python and Twitter's API to create this Bot.
The script will pull images and the source of the image from Safebooru and will upload to a twitter account.

Images above 5MB must be compressed to be able to upload so I used Pillow package to compress the images.
